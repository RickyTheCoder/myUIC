  To end all the suffering of UIC students, our team decided to take a step forward and make a change. We aim to transform, refine, and revolutionize our school website into an IOS app. The current website is difficult to navigate, fails to highlight important information, and lacks optimization for our fellow mobile users. This makes our students' and faculty' lives more frustrating than ever. With the myUIC app, we are creating a platform, a bridge, that improves accessibility and communication for UIC people. Our app doesn’t just replicate my.uic.edu—it elevates it. Imagine having all the essential features plus everything you could ever need for university life. Interactive calendars? Grade trackers? An AI assistant? You name it! Students already have enough on their plates. The app will modernize our school’s experience, making it faster, smarter, and more intuitive for the entire campus community so that students have one less thing to worry about.
