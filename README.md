## Overview:

  Like every UIC student, we’ve had our fair share of struggles with the university portal, my.uic.edu, getting lost in a maze of menus and feeling frustrated from trying to use it on a mobile device. It’s about time we ask, “Why on earth does it have to be this way?” That’s when it clicked: we could build something better. Something efficient. Something that actually makes student life, our life, easier. That's why we built myUIC, a platform that improves accessibility and communication for all students at UIC.

## How we built it:

  The tech stack includes React Native for a user-friendly UI, Node.Js for the back-end, and Firebase for user authentication.
